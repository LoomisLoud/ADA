# Recommending movies from tweets

## Abstract
Wouldn't it be great to be able to recommend movies for every single average user of twitter, this is the main goal of the project. We want to be able to ask you for your twitter handle, and if you've sent a few tweets, we should be able to recommend movies for you to watch ! 

We want to be able to recommend movies related to what you like generally and not forcibly linked to which movies you previously watched.

## Dataset
We use the twitter dataset EPFL's Data Lab provided coupled with the well known [TMDB Kaggle database](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data). The idea here is to select english tweets from the dataset, rating movies, and select these users and all of their tweets. Also, pick movies from the database that are talked about in the tweets. There never seemed to be a need for us to enrich the current dataset.

## Data Analysis
You can find in the notebook the analysis we made upon the genres of the rated movies, and the contents of the tweets. 

We started off by visualizing the movies clustered by genres. As expected, the clusters are defined by a mix of multiple genres, which makes sense since movies are categorized as multiples genres most of the time.

Afterwards, we took our focus to the tweets' contents, performing a topic detection using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. It turns out that the most important topics were the movies ! Which made us think that recommending movies using the tweets themselves as a bag of words could be a good idea.

## Recommender system
Here is how we recommend movies to twitter users. We find the most similar users from our target by cosine distance, and then compute the recommendations by averaging out the ratings of the closest few.
